"When Love Kills Love"

Suddenly, I think I always knew
I had my share of mistakes, made quite a few
Finally I know and that's for sure
I don't look back in anger anymore

Suddenly, the sun comes up again
There's a new beginning when we pass the end
Finally I know and that's for sure
I don't look back in anger anymore

When love kills love
Will someone rescue me?
When love kills love
It's cutting through so deep

Suddenly, I wake up from the dream
Someone tells me I've been talking in the sleep
Finally I know and that's for sure
I don't believe in daydreams anymore

When love kills love
Will someone rescue me?
When love kills love
It's cutting through so deep
